## Prereqs
> This script runs on Windows and Linux, written in Python 3.8

## Installation
> Once Python is installed, run the setup.py script to install all external packages.

## Purpose
> This project adopts the features of the screenshotAssistant project in my repository.
> The big difference is that this program also logs keys as a sentence and written to a file.
> Then that file is reformatted and saved in a new file with a clean, easily readable format.

## How to use
- Open up shell such as command prompt or terminal
- Enter directory containing program and execute in shell
- Open the graphical file manager and go to path specified in program
- Click on the open CMD and hit enter
- Look at the file manager to watch screenshots
- Any keys pressed will be buffered into a variable and will be entered as a sentence when enter is pressed\
- Hit escape to pause program and cleanly format key logs to be written to a new file
- If you want to start again hit enter again
- OR if you would like to exit hit Ctrl + C (KeyboardInterrupt)
