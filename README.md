## Prereqs
> To make sure this program runs as designed Python 3.8 
> should be installed. Also any of the required modules 
> need to be installed. I recommend simply googling the 
> module name and finding the documentation. The PIP 
> command for installation is usually one of the first 
> things mentioned. Also with Python it is common to have 
> multiple modules with similar names. So if errors are 
> being raised about not having a certain module it is 
> most likely the wrong module with a similar name to 
> the one that is required was installed instead of the 
> required module.

## Installation
> Google Python downloads and obtain version 3.8 from the 
> official website. Run the installer and follow the default 
> installation procedures. Also Google any required modules 
> and install them with PIP in Command Prompt.

## Purpose
> This project adopts the features of the screenshotAssistan
> project in my repository. The big difference is that this
> program also logs keys as a sentence and written to a file.
> Then that file is reformated and saved in a new file with
> a clean, easily readable format.

## How to use
- Open up Command Prompt(CMD)
- Enter directory containing program and execute in shell
- Open the graphical file manager and go to path specified in program
- Click on the open CMD and hit enter
- Look at the file manager to watch screenshots
- Any keys pressed will be buffered into a variable and will be entered as a sentence when enter is pressed\
- Hit escape to pause program and cleanly format key logs to be written to a new file
- If you want to start again hit enter again
